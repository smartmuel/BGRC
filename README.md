## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    cd BG-Resource-Counter
    ```

2.  **Open `index.html` in your web browser:**  For local mode, simply open the `index.html` file directly in your browser.

3.  **(Optional) Firebase Setup for Server/Client Modes:**
    *   **Create a Firebase Project:**
        *   Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
        *   Click "Add project" and follow the steps to create a new project.
    *   **Set up Realtime Database:**
        *   In your Firebase project, navigate to "Realtime Database".
        *   Create a Realtime Database instance.
        *   **Security Rules:** For initial testing, you can set your database rules to public read/write access. **However, for production use, you should configure secure rules.**  For example, you can use the following (adjust as needed for your security requirements):
            ```json
            {
              "rules": {
                "sessions": {
                  "$sessionId": {
                    ".read": true, // Adjust read rules as needed
                    ".write": true // Adjust write rules as needed
                  }
                }
              }
            }
            ```
        *   **Get Firebase Configuration:**
            *   In your Firebase project settings, find the "Config" section (usually under "Project settings" > "General" > "Web apps").
            *   Copy the Firebase configuration object (it looks like a JSON object with `apiKey`, `authDomain`, `databaseURL`, etc.).
    *   **Enter Firebase Configuration in the Application:**
        *   Open `index.html` in your browser.
        *   Click the "üåê" (Server/Client Settings) button.
        *   Check the "Show Firebase Config Fields" checkbox.
        *   Paste the Firebase configuration details from your Firebase project into the corresponding input fields (`apiKey`, `authDomain`, `databaseURL`, etc.).
        *   Click the "Save Firebase Config" button. This saves the configuration in your browser's local storage for future use.

## Server/Client Mode Explanation

*   **Local Mode:** This is the default mode. All data is stored locally in your browser's local storage. No Firebase connection is used. Ideal for solo play or offline use.
*   **Server Mode:** When you start a server session, your browser becomes the server. It uses Firebase Realtime Database to host the game state. Other players can join as clients. You are responsible for saving and managing the game configuration on the server.
*   **Client Mode:** In client mode, you connect to a server session hosted by another player. Your resource counts are synchronized with the server and other clients in real-time. You cannot modify the game configuration directly; you only interact with the counters.

## Data Import and Export

*   **Export Data:** Use the "Export Data" button in the Global Settings to download your current resource setup as a `resources.json` file. This file can be used as a backup or to share your setup with others.
*   **Import Data:** Use the "Import Data" button in the Global Settings to upload a `resources.json` file. This will replace your current resource configuration with the data from the imported file.

## Customization

*   **CSS Variables:** The `style.css` file uses CSS variables (`:root`) at the beginning for easy customization of colors, fonts, and button styles. Modify these variables to change the overall look and feel of the application.
*   **Images:** Use custom images for resources to visually represent them in your game.
*   **Funny Names:**  Add humorous names to resources for a more playful experience.
*   **Settings:** Utilize the various settings options to tailor the application to your specific gaming needs and preferences.

- **Roll Result:** The dice roll result will be displayed next to the dice button.
- **Result Toggle:**  For standard dice rolls (d6, etc.), you can click on the result to toggle between showing the detailed roll (individual dice values) and the sum.
- **Dice Settings:** Customize dice type, number of dice, and animation in the resource settings (see [Settings](#settings)).

### Settings

Click the **‚öôÔ∏è (Gear)** icon in the top right corner to open the Global Settings panel.

- **Dark Mode:** Toggles between light and dark themes for comfortable viewing in different environments.
- **Globally Hide Funny Names:**  Disables the use of funny names for clients, reverting to standard client names.
- **Globally Hide All Images:** Hides all resource images to reduce visual clutter or improve performance.

**Game Settings:**

- **Enable Global Counter Limit:** Activates a limit on the total sum of all resource counters.
- **Global Counter Limit:**  Sets the maximum total count allowed across all resources when the global limit is enabled.

**Data Options:**

- **Export Data:** Downloads your current resource configuration and counter values as a `resources.json` file.
- **Import Data:** Allows you to upload a `resources.json` file to load previously saved configurations.

### Server/Client Mode

Click the **üåê (Globe)** icon in the top right corner to open the Server/Client Settings panel.

- **Client Name:** Enter a name for yourself to be identified in server/client sessions.
- **Mode:** Select the operating mode:
    - **Client:** Join an existing server session to synchronize resource counts with others.
    - **Server:** Start a new session and act as the server, allowing clients to connect and synchronize.
    - **Local:**  Use the application in standalone mode, without server synchronization.

**Session Management (Server/Client Modes):**

- **Session ID (Client Mode):** Enter the Session ID provided by the server to join a session.
- **Connect Button (Client Mode):** Click to connect to the server session.
- **Start New Session Button (Server Mode):** Click to start a new server session and generate a unique Session ID.
- **Session ID Display (Server Mode):** Displays the generated Session ID for your server session.
- **Export SDK Config (Server Mode):** Exports a JSON file (`sdk-config.json`) containing Firebase configuration and Session ID, simplifying client connection.
- **Import SDK Config & Join (Client Mode):** Allows clients to import an `sdk-config.json` file to automatically configure Firebase and join a session.
- **QR Code (Server Mode):** A QR code is generated in server mode that clients can scan to easily join the session.

### Data Options

- **Export Data:** Downloads your current resource configuration and counter values as a `resources.json` file.
- **Import Data:** Allows you to upload a `resources.json` file to load previously saved configurations.

## Server/Client Synchronization (Firebase)

The BG Resource Counter utilizes Firebase Realtime Database for real-time synchronization in Server and Client modes.

### Setting up Firebase

To use Server and Client modes, you need to configure Firebase:

1. **Create a Firebase Project:**
   - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Click "Add project" and follow the steps to create a new project.
2. **Get Firebase Configuration:**
   - In your Firebase project, go to "Project settings" (gear icon next to "Project Overview").
   - Scroll down to the "Your apps" section and click the web icon (`</>`).
   - Register your app (you can use a placeholder name).
   - In the "Add Firebase SDK" step, select "CDN" and copy the **"Config"** object.
   - Paste the configuration details into the corresponding input fields in the "Server/Client Settings" panel within the BG Resource Counter:
     - `apiKey`
     - `authDomain`
     - `databaseURL`
     - `projectId`
     - `storageBucket`
     - `messagingSenderId`
     - `appId`
3. **Save Firebase Config:** Click the "Save Firebase Config" button.

**Important:** Ensure that your Firebase Realtime Database rules are set to allow read and write access for authenticated users or public access for testing purposes. **Be mindful of security implications when setting database rules.**

### Server Mode

1. **Configure Firebase (as described above).**
2. **Select "Server" mode in the "Server/Client Settings" panel.**
3. **Click "Start New Session".**
4. **Share the Session ID:** Provide the displayed Session ID or the QR code to clients who want to join your session.
5. **Manage Resources:** As the server, you can add, modify, and remove resources. These changes will be synchronized with connected clients.
6. **Counter Updates:** When you update a counter, the changes will be reflected in real-time for all connected clients.

### Client Mode

1. **Configure Firebase (as described above) or import an SDK Config file.**
2. **Select "Client" mode in the "Server/Client Settings" panel.**
3. **Enter the Session ID provided by the server.**
4. **Click "Connect".**
5. **Synchronized Counters:** Once connected, your resource counters will be synchronized with the server and other clients in the session. Counter updates from any client will be reflected on your screen in real-time.

### Local Mode

- **Select "Local" mode in the "Server/Client Settings" panel.**
- In Local mode, all data is stored in your browser's local storage. Server synchronization is disabled.
- This mode is suitable for single-player use or when real-time collaboration is not required.

## Data Persistence

- **Local Storage:** In Local mode and for global settings, data is stored in your browser's local storage. This means your resources and settings will be preserved across browser sessions on the same device.
- **Firebase Realtime Database:** In Server and Client modes, resource configurations and counter values are stored in Firebase Realtime Database, enabling real-time synchronization and cross-device access for session participants.

## Customization Options

- **Dark Mode:**  Enable Dark Mode for a visually darker theme.
- **Disable Animations:** Turn off dice roll animations for faster loading and performance.
- **Funny Names:**  Enable or disable the use of humorous, automatically generated names for clients in server/client modes.
- **Hide All Images:**  Option to globally hide all resource images for a cleaner interface.
- **Global Counter Limit:**  Set a limit to the total sum of all resource counters.
- **Resource-Specific Settings:**  Each resource can be further customized with options like:
    - Image visibility
    - Counter visibility
    - Increment/decrement values
    - Minimum/Maximum counts
    - Dice rolling settings
    - Funny name usage
    - Counter visibility to other players
